    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Trees:\n",
    "Decision trees are used in control systems where an induction of decision tree is used to control the nonlinear dynamical systems. Their strength comes from their ability to segment the data into groups reliably and identify the interactive relationships between the variables in the dataset. Now, decision trees can be very effective when there is a sufficient subset of the classes in the dataset that can effectively represent the data and provide a classification with a complexity of O(log2(N)). However, Decision trees can easily get complicated when the number of classes is larger. That could lead into number of terminals or leaf nodes than classes and that will increase the search time and the memory space requirements, because it’s hard to optimize and efficiency and accuracy at the same time. **\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic Regression:\n",
    "Logistic regression can be used to predict datasets that have dual outcomes. For example: it is used to predict if a patient has a disease based on observed characteristics. One of the advantages of using it is that it can provide a logical and easy to follow explanation to the problem. That is dues to the fact that, logistic regression models the probability of the response of the equation providing an s-shaped curve that represent the prediction. It also can avoid overfitting problems by regularizing the algorithm. However, when the problem has a complex or nonlinear decision, the logistic function performance drops sharply and underperforms. **\n",
    "\n",
    "**AdaBoosting:\n",
    "AdaBoosting is used in recognition and detection applications, such as, face detection. It is very effective because it can produce classifier with error margin close to neural networks but in less training time. Its main advantage is the combination of simple classifiers that makes it a faster learner in general compared to relying on one complex classifier. However, If the weak classifiers are too complex, that might lead to overfitting. **\n",
    "\n",
    "**The problem this assignment is trying to solve is a binary problem where we have to classify the records based on their income. This makes binary classifiers the obvious choice for this problem dues to the simplicity to structure the models. AdaBoosting can solve binary and multi class problems and due to the, relatively, simple and small data, it is a good candidate to solve the problem. \n",

    "### Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline\n",
    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).\n",
    " - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.\n",
    " - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.\n",
    "   - Record the total prediction time.\n",
    " - Calculate the accuracy score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",
    " - Calculate the F-score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",

    "**The charity donors’ problem that we are trying to solve is a binary decision problem, and all of the three learners are suitable for such a problem. Regarding performance, we can conclude that all three models can perform at relatively the same level. The accuracy, and training time required have a very similar or close result for the three models. However, that is looking generally at the three classifiers without optimizing their performance and the potential for future improvements. When we take into account optimizing the performance of the classifiers to get better results, AdaBoosting optimization is the easier choice that yields the best results. Therefore, it is the most suitable for this problem. **"

    "**In general when a model is being created, you take into account the classes that the dataset consist of and build the model accordingly. After you have a made the model and want to improve the results of the prediction, you try to optimize and that usually increase the complexity of the model. AdaBoosting model is different as it uses multiple “simple/weak” models that are trained on different subset of the data. Essentially, this method will need more data to train these multiple models on, but you avoid the complexity of the other models and the other problems associated with it. Each one of these individual learners will focus on attributes that the other learners are weak at learning and that happens through a sequence of iterations through the data by the algorithm. At the end, you end up with multiple learners that are easier to train and produce accurate results without the need of complicating one model to  cover the whole dataset. \n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
